To differentiate ourselves, we should focus on the agile work environment and address gaps that Copilot does not cover.\n- Steven suggested tailoring our solution towards an agile work environment and using context from past meetings to generate outputs.\n- Cost is another differentiating factor, as our solution is cheaper than Copilot.\n- Jason proposed leveraging Copilot to tailor it to our needs instead of competing directly.\n- However, access to Copilot is limited, so it may be better to create our own agile-focused solution for Telstra.\n- David mentioned the usefulness of a centralized dashboard to manage meetings and create a consistent timeline.\n- The group agreed to shift the focus of our solution towards Telstra's agile work environment and explore the ticket generation as a main feature.\n- Steven will conduct further research on agile practices and the use of a centralized dashboard.\n- Chris left the meeting early, but his input on the use of retrospectives was noted.\n- The group discussed the potential relevance of meeting minutes and retrospectives in an agile context.\n- David and Steven agreed to keep working on the current solution while adapting it for the new requirements.\n- Steven will follow up on receiving the requirements file.\n- The meeting ended with plans to reconvene later for further discussions and updates.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Steven will research agile practices and the use of a centralized dashboard.\n- David and Steven will adapt and improve the current solution.\n- Jason and Steven will discuss the use of Copilot for integration.\n\nMeeting adjourned at 3.00 PM.\n\nMinutes prepared by [Your Name]"
