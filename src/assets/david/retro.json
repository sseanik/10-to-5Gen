            "1": "Differentiate our product with an Agile focus: Tailor our solution towards an Agile work environment, since this is something that the current copilot solution lacks. This can include features that reduce time-consuming administrative tasks and cater specifically to Agile ceremonies such as retrospectives and stand-ups.",
            "2": "Make the most out of the context window: Ensure that our solution can accumulate knowledge from past meetings and use it to provide valuable insights. This can involve improving the meeting generator to take into account the purpose of the meeting (retro, stand-up, ceremony) and adjust the output accordingly.",
            "3": "Create a centralized dashboard: Differentiate our product by developing a central dashboard that allows users to manage and track all their meetings and associated tasks. This will add value by providing a centralized and streamlined experience, which is currently lacking in the copilot solution.",
            "4": "Integrate with copilot in the long term: While access to copilot is currently limited, we can consider integrating our solution with copilot in the future. This will require collaboration and co-development with Microsoft, leveraging our strategic partnership, and allowing for a more seamless experience for users.",
            "5": "Investigate Telstra-specific needs: Research and analyze Telstra's Agile work environment and identify any specific requirements and pain points that can be addressed by our solution. This will enable us to create a product that is tailored to Telstra's needs and provides a unique value proposition.",
            "6": "Gather requirements: Chase up the requirements from the product stakeholders, such as the business and executive teams, to ensure that their needs are considered in the development of the solution."
